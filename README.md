8. **Custom Color Extraction**: Allow users to select specific areas of a webpage for color extraction.

9. **Color Trends**: Analyze and display color trends across popular websites or specific industries.

10. **API Access**: Provide an API for developers to integrate Chromatic's functionality into their own tools.

11. **Multiple Color Models**: Support RGB, HSL, CMYK, and other color models in addition to HEX.

12. **Color Blindness Simulation**: Show how extracted colors appear to individuals with various types of color blindness.

13. **Palette Sharing**: Allow users to share extracted palettes directly to social media or design communities.

14. **Browser Sync**: Sync saved palettes across devices using Chrome sync.

15. **Customizable Extraction**: Let users adjust the number of colors extracted or set color extraction algorithms.

16. **Color Psychology Insights**: Provide information on the psychological effects and common uses of extracted colors.

17. **Localization**: Support multiple languages to cater to a global user base.

18. **Theme Generation**: Generate full website color themes based on extracted palettes.

19. **Image Color Extraction**: Allow users to upload images for color extraction, not just webpages.

20. **Color Palette Communities**: Create a platform for users to share and rate color palettes extracted from various websites.
